MANOOL is a [homoiconic][], [dynamic][], and [multi-paradigm][] [general-purpose][] [computer][] [programming][] [language][] with a [functional core][]. The
author's [implementation][] of MANOOL is made for [native-code][] [run-time][] [environments][], is written in *idiomatic* [C++11][] (with [GCC-specific][]
extensions), and currently runs under several [Unix-like][] [operating systems][] (OSes) on a number of [CPU][] [instruction-set architectures][] (ISAs). The
implementation is a [free and open-source][] (FOSS) [software][] [development][] [tool][] published under the version 3 of the [GNU][] [General Public
License][] (GPLv3).

Purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANOOL is characterized as a _general-purpose_ language because it is *not* specific to a particular [problem domain][], and it is instead broadly applicable
across several problem domains. However, it is meant to compare and compete directly with such programming languages as [Python], [PHP], [Ruby], [Perl], and
[Tcl][] (i.e., so-called [scripting languages][]), or even [Scheme] and [Common Lisp], which somehow dooms its purpose.

In overall, MANOOL is a practical language: it is conceived as a tool useful in the professional field of programming rather than as a [proof of concept][] for
any new programming techniques or mechanisms, although incidentally its [syntax][] and [semantics][] do have a combination of unusual features.

[semantics]:           //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)   "Wikipedia: Semantics"


Motivation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project MANOOL emerged out of mere programming language enthusiasm and frustration with existing languages but is based on ideas and experience its author
acquired throughout more than 25 years. Its design and implementation is the result of about 3.5 years of almost full-time work.


Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following ["Hello, world!" program][] provides a basic idea of what [programs][] in MANOOL may look like:

    {{extern "manool.org.18/std/0.6/all"} in WriteLine[Out; "Hello, world!"]}

And the following MANOOL [expression][] evaluates to a ([recursive][]) MANOOL [procedure][] (a function in more conventional terminology) used to calculate the
[factorial][] of an [integral][] [argument][]:

    { let rec
      { Fact =
        { proc { N } as
        : if N == 0 then 1 else
          N * Fact[N - 1]
        }
      }
      in
      Fact
    }

It is worth to observe that while [source code][] in MANOOL may look at first sight unfamiliar or even awkward, there are really good reasons behind it since
the syntax of MANOOL is a result of many design trade-offs. However, as in the case of [Smalltalk], the syntax of MANOOL is actually so simple that it could be
"described on a postcard".

Goals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANOOL has *explicitly* stated design goals (ordered according to priority), which are
  1. [implementation simplicity][] (which is the sole most important consideration in the design);
  2. [expressive power][] (in practical sense), [usability][], and general utility (value for consumers); attention to syntax and semantics details;
  3. [correctness][], [security][], and overall [quality][] of implementation; [run-time reliability][];
  4. [run-time performance][] and [scalability][]; and
  5. consistency, completeness, [orthogonality][] of features and language [elegance][]; [conceptual economy][] and purity.

The project MANOOL strives to satisfy *all* of the above goals (in that order) and do it *better* than existing alternatives would do!

Note that quality of [diagnostics][] and [coding defect][] prevention have been deliberately left, however, among low-priority goals.

Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implementation simplicity
The MANOOL [translator][] fits in less than 10K [lines of code][] (KLOC) in C++11 plus less than 500 LOC in MANOOL, which covers the core language as well as
the [standard][] [library][].

[translator]:    //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translator_(computing) "Wikipedia: Translator"
[lines of code]: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_of_code          "Wikipedia: Lines of code"
[standard]:      //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library       "Wikipedia: Standard library"
[library]:       //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)    "Wikipedia: Library"

### Expressive power
MANOOL is directly suitable for accurately expressing [algorithms][] (*up to* [asymptotic computational complexity][]) as complex as those that one might find
in [computer-science][] (CS) papers where mostly some form of [high-level][] [pseudocode][] is encountered.

### Run-time performance
According to simple synthetic [benchmarks][], the MANOOL implementation executes programs notably faster than some competitors and slightly faster or on a par
with other competitors.

[benchmarks]: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing) "Wikipedia: Benchmark"

### Run-time reliability
When needed, MANOOL programs can be instructed to recover even from [dynamic memory][] (heap and stack) exhaustion.
